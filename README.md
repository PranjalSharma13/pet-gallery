The Challenge
The task is to build out a front-end accomplishing the following using React and Typescript

Display a list of images. Make a GET request to /pets to retrieve a JSON array of JSON objects that represent pet objects. These JSON objects will include properties like an image URL, title, description, entity creation date. You need to present these images and associated data in a compelling and interactive way. Use fetch for fetching data.
